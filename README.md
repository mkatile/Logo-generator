# Logo-generator

## The Task

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an [SVG file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file. The application includes `Triangle`, `Circle`, and `Square` classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest.

The application uses "Jest" and "Inquirer" and will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Link
Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, here is the [link] (doc:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pYBmnReIpdAzQMbH5h5p5xIF4VmtuFhq/view?usp=sharing) to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and passes all of the tests.
